# __POMOjs__
### *A task-based, configurable, & user-friendly pomodoro clock app.*
##### Your new digital assistant will always be there to assist you. Want to manipulate time and space, like a lvl. 90 Chrono-Mage? Do you crave the adrenaline-rush of crushing your competition violently beneath the wheels of your armored, tomato-shaped chariot. Get ready to produce 1,000,000x more than 1,000,000 of your peers. All while being better than __everyone__, at __everything__.

Built with __*Reactjs*__, bootstrapped using the oh-so-awesome __*create-react-app CLI*__, and written using all of the niftiest "bleeding-edge" javascript syntax features a la __*Babeljs*__.
